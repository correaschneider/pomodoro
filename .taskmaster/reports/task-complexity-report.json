			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) repository layout per ADR-008; (2) pyproject.toml with PEP 621, Python>=3.12, extras and entry point; (3) developer tooling (ruff/black, pytest.ini, .gitignore, semantic commits); (4) centralized logging module per ADR-012 using platformdirs and RotatingFileHandler, idempotent setup, captureWarnings; (5) logger namespaces and docs; (6) __main__ bootstrap with --smoke; (7) unit/integration tests for log creation, rotation, namespace routing. Include cross-platform paths and acceptance criteria for each.",
			"reasoning": "Cross-platform scaffolding and logging with rotation, namespacing, and tooling setup adds moderate complexity, but scope is well-bounded and testable."

			"taskTitle": "Core timer domain and use-cases",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) models (enums, Session dataclass); (2) ports and callback types; (3) TimerService constructor and state; (4) monotonic ticking loop with pause; (5) API methods with reentrancy/state guards; (6) observer registry and safe emission; (7) concurrency/thread lifecycle and idempotency; (8) domain errors; (9) comprehensive tests incl. properties, concurrency, drift bounds. Define acceptance criteria for state transitions and callback ordering.",
			"reasoning": "Non-trivial concurrency, state management, and timing accuracy with robust error handling and extensive tests drive high complexity."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) QApplication bootstrap with translator hook; (2) thread-safe QObject bridge; (3) MainWindow UI; (4) controller wiring and Pause/Resume toggle; (5) time formatting utility + tests; (6) settings dialog stub; (7) graceful shutdown and tray-aware closeEvent; (8) pytest-qt integration tests and basic logging. Specify signal/slot threading and UI update acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "GUI wiring to a threaded domain via signals/slots and maintaining responsive stateful controls is moderately complex and requires careful testing."

Define enable/disable and label toggle acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Tray UI is straightforward but has platform nuances and state synchronization requirements with the domain and GUI."

Include thread-hopping to the GUI thread where needed.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple OS backends with graceful degradation, UI overlay, and robust error handling make this integration-heavy and error-prone."

Define serialization formats and transaction boundaries.",
			"reasoning": "Database setup, schema, repositories, and event-driven writes add moderate complexity with concurrency considerations and cross-platform paths."

Specify normalization (en-USâ†’en_US).",
			"reasoning": "Runtime language switching and plugin domains plus build-time tooling and packaging raise complexity beyond basic gettext usage."

			"reasoning": "Dynamic discovery/loading with metadata validation, version gating, security posture, and failure isolation is complex and risk-prone."
